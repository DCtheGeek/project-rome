# Using Microsoft Graph's Device Relay REST APIs

Device Relay features can be implemented through REST API calls with Microsoft Graph. You can find more information and API reference documentation in the [Project Rome section of the Microsoft Graph docs](/graph/api/resources/project-rome-overview#devices).

Implementing with Microsoft Graph allows you to discover your devices, launch apps, and interact with app services from any device capable of making HTTP requests. Microsoft Graph makes these scenarios simpler to implement than on the native platform SDKs, but it does not support all of the features Project Rome features or offer a native object model.
