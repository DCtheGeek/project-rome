# Using Microsoft Graph's User Activities REST APIs

The User Activities feature can be implemented through REST API calls with Microsoft Graph. You can find more information and API reference documentation in the [Project Rome section of the Microsoft Graph docs](/graph/api/resources/project-rome-overview#activities).

This allows you to create, publish, update, and read Windows-style User Activities from any device capable of making HTTP requests. Microsoft Graph makes these scenarios simpler to implement than on the native platform SDKs, but it does not support all of the Project Rome features or provide a native object model.
